                    <p>Description: Draco Malfoy is a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius and
                        Narcissa Malfoy. The son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the
                        importance of blood purity. He looked down on half-bloods and Muggle-borns. Draco
                        attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was sorted into Slytherin House
                        the moment the Sorting Hat touched his head.</p>

                    <h2>Species: Half-Giant</h2>
                    <p>Description: Professor Rubeus Hagrid is an English half-giant wizard. Hagrid stood at
                        eleven feet, six inches tall. Hagrid attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and was
                        sorted into Gryffindor house. In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for
                        the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack
                        several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid's wand
                        was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts.</p>
